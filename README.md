# The Tech Blog 

This app is a full-stack application that uses all three `MVC` components.

##  Description

This app is a `CMS-style` blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It follows the `MVC` paradigm in its architectural structure, using `Handlebars.js` as the templating language, `Sequelize` as the ORM, `MySQL` as the database, and the `express-session` npm package for authentication.

## Installation 

1. Download and install [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en), if you don't have already.
         
1. Install `npm` - node package manager to initialize the project
    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
1. Install nodemon as dev dependency to develop the project
    ```
    npm i -D nodemon
    ```
1. Install `MySQL2` database
    ```
    npm i mysql2
    ```
1. Install `Express` server
    ```
    npm i express
    ```
1. Install `Sequelize` ORM
    ```
    npm i sequelize 
    ```
1. Install `dotenv` to securely store password  
    ```
    npm i dotenv
    ```
1. Install `dayjs` for date/time manipulation
    ```
    npm i dayjs
    ```
1. Install `bcrypt` to hash user passwords  
    ```
    npm i bcrypt
    ```
1. Install `Express session` to create user cookies
    ```
    npm i express-session   
    ```
1. Install `Express session sequelize` to store session in SQL
    ```
    npm i connect-session-sequelize 
    ```
1. Install `tailwindcss` CSS framework as dev dependency, and initialize it. For more information, refer to [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    ```
    npm i -D tailwindcss
    npx tailwindcss init
    ```
1. Install tailwindcss `typography plugin` to add beautiful typographic defaults to the html content rendered by server. For more information, refer to [tailwind typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)
    ```
    npm i -D @tailwindcss/typography
    ```
1. Install `daisyUI` tailwindcss plugin, an open-source component library
    ``` 
    npm i -D daisyui@latest
    ```
    *Note: All dev dependency modules are optional. Also, I highly recommend that [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) dev dependencies be used to have your code fixed and formatted for you.*

1. Finally, install `Handlebars` to create webpage templates
    ```
    npm i express-handlebars
    ```

## Issue
This app has still some bugs.
1. The navigation links are functioning properly. However, the back button doesn't work as expected. I need to learn more about `location.replace` etc and fix this.
1. The pictures are only place holders. They are not dynamic. So, user file upload function is still lacking in this app.
1. Some new data is not rendered correctly as the seeds data.
